<h1>How It Works</h1>
<pre>⭐ How It Works — invoiceto.app
Create professional, internationally-compliant invoices in seconds
invoiceto.app is a lightweight, browser-based invoice generator designed for freelancers, small businesses, digital agencies, and international contractors.
No signup. No stored data. No back-end. Everything happens securely inside your browser.
This guide explains exactly how invoiceto.app works, how to generate invoices correctly for international clients, and how our automatic tax logic helps you stay compliant across borders.

✅ 1. Enter your company details (Supplier)
Start by filling in your business information on the left-hand side:
* Company name
* Address
* IBAN, BIC/SWIFT, bank name
* Supplier tax number (VAT/GST/DPH/IVA number)
* Supplier country
Why this matters
Your supplier country and tax number are used to automatically determine whether VAT (or local tax) must be applied.
This ensures compliance with EU and non-EU invoicing rules.

✅ 2. Add your client details (Payer)
Next, enter your client’s:
* Company name
* Address
* Client tax number (if registered)
* Client country
Smart tax detection
invoiceto.app automatically checks:
* Is the client in the EU?
* Does the client have a valid tax number?
* Are both supplier and client located in the same EU country?
* Is the transaction intra-EU and zero-rated?
This removes the guesswork and prevents tax calculation errors.

✅ 3. Set invoice metadata
You can freely customize:
* Invoice number
* Issue date (auto-filled for you)
* Due date (auto-filled +14 days)
* Currency (EUR/USD/GBP or any currency code)
* Tax label (VAT, TAX, GST, DPH, IVA, etc.)
* Tax rate (%)
Flexible for international business
All currencies and tax systems are supported.
The preview updates instantly as you type.

✅ 4. Add up to 10 invoice items
Add your services or products:
* Description
* Quantity
* Unit price
The app calculates automatically:
* Line totals
* Net amount
* Tax amount
* Total due
The preview shows the invoice exactly as it will appear in PDF format.

✅ 5. Automatic International Tax Logic
invoiceto.app includes built-in rules for EU and international invoicing.
The rules applied:
1. Supplier has NO tax number → Tax is NOT applied  
This is common for freelancers below VAT thresholds.
2. Supplier has a tax number, client does NOT → Tax is applied at the entered rate
3. Both parties in the EU with tax numbers
* Different EU countries → 0% tax (intra-EU zero-rate)
* Same EU country → Tax is applied at your entered rate
4. All other cases → Tax is applied normally
Clear display in the UI and preview
The invoice will show:
* “not applied”
* “VAT 0% (intra-EU zero rate)”
* “VAT 21%”
…depending on your inputs.

✅ 6. View the live A4 invoice preview
On the right side, you see a real-time A4 invoice preview:
* Precise margins
* Clean layout
* Automatic formatting
* Country and currency badges
* Ready for PDF printing
The preview always shows exactly what will be printed.

✅ 7. Export to PDF (browser print)
Click Export to PDF:
* The app hides all non-invoice elements
* Only the invoice page is printed
* Page size is exactly A4 (210×297mm)
* Margins are optimized
* The invoice prints perfectly on a single page
No third-party servers. No watermark. No compression issues.
